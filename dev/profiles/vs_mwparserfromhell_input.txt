'''Bootham Crescent''' is a sports stadium in [[York]], North Yorkshire, England, and is the home of [[association football]] club [[York City F.C.|York City]] and [[rugby league]] club [[York City Knights]]. With a capacity of 8,256, the ground is located near the centre of the city, just over a mile from [[York railway station]].

York City leased land at Bootham Crescent from [[York Cricket Club]] as a replacement for their ground at [[Fulfordgate]], which was on the outskirts of the city. The ground was constructed in four months, and officially opened on 31 August 1932. During the Second World War, the Popular Stand was converted into an [[air-raid shelter]], and the ground suffered slight damage when a bomb landed on houses along the Shipton Street End. York purchased Bootham Crescent for £4,075 in September 1948. Floodlights were fitted at the ground in 1959, and were replaced by ones twice as powerful in 1995. A number of improvements were made in the early 1980s, with a gymnasium, offices and a lounge for officials built.

The David Longhurst Stand opened in 1991 after a roof was erected on the Shipton Street End. It was named after the former York player [[David Longhurst]], who died during a match at the ground in 1990. Bootham Crescent hosted football in [[English Football League|the Football League]] from 1932 to 2004 and from 2012 to 2016, both spells ending after York were [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] into [[non-League football]]. The [[Naming rights|ground was renamed]] KitKat Crescent from 2005 to 2010 as part of a sponsorship deal with [[Nestlé]]. York are expected to move to a [[York Community Stadium|community stadium]] at Monks Cross in [[Huntington, City of York|Huntington]] in mid 2019, and the Bootham Crescent site will be used for housing.

Bootham Crescent comprises four stands: the Main Stand, the Popular Stand, the David Longhurst Stand and the Grosvenor Road End. The ground has held a league representative match, neutral club matches, and schoolboy and youth international matches. Other than football, it has hosted a concert, a grand firework display, [[American football]] and rugby league matches and [[beer festival]]s. The record attendance of 28,123 was set in March 1938, for an [[FA Cup]] match against [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]]. The highest seasonal average attendance of 10,412 was achieved in [[1948–49 Football League Third Division North|1948–49]].

By the early 1980s cracks had appeared in the wall built at the back of the Grosvenor Road End.<ref name="The Complete Record 115"/> The rear of the terracing was cordoned off, and the capacity of the ground reduced to under 13,500.<ref name="The Complete Record 115"/> The Grosvenor Road End was segregated and allocated to away supporters, and fencing was erected for the first time before the FA Cup match against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in February 1985.<ref name="The Complete Record 115"/> All the fencing had been dismantled by the early 2000s.<ref name="The Complete Record 115"/> During the 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons, problems had arisen in handling big crowds, due to the ground having only two of four sides available for entry and exit, and the home supporters funnelling through the car park to the Shipton Street End.<ref name="The Complete Record 115"/> Extensive improvements were made in the summer of 1985 for approximately £100,000, and eight new turnstiles were installed at the Shipton Street End.<ref name="The Complete Record 115"/> Further, the dressing rooms were refurbished to incorporate new baths and showers, and a new referees' changing room and physiotherapist's treatment room were readied.<ref name="The Complete Record 115"/> Hospitality boxes were built into the Main Stand during 1986–87, and video equipment was installed inside the ground.<ref name="The Complete Record 115"/> Crash barriers were strengthened, meaning ground safety requirements were met.<ref name="The Complete Record 115"/> These improvements meant that shortly before the [[Taylor Report]] was published, the ground's capacity was 14,109, including 3,059 seats.<ref name="Football Grounds of Britain 421"/> However, by September 1989, the capacity had been increased to 14,628.<ref name="The Complete Record 115"/>
