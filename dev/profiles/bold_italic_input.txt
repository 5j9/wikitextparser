'''40 Wall Street''' (also the '''Trump Building'''; formerly the '''Bank of Manhattan Trust Building''' and '''Manhattan Company Building''') is a {{Convert|927|ft|m|-tall|adj=mid}} [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-Gothic]] skyscraper on [[Wall Street]] between [[Nassau Street (Manhattan)|Nassau]] and [[William Street (Manhattan)|William]] streets in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]], New York, U.S. Erected in 1929–1930 as the headquarters of the [[Manhattan Company]], the building was designed by [[H. Craig Severance]] with [[Yasuo Matsui]] and [[Shreve, Lamb & Harmon|Shreve & Lamb]]. The building is a [[New York City designated landmark]] and is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP); it is also a contributing property to the [[Wall Street Historic District (Manhattan)|Wall Street Historic District]], an NRHP district.

The building is on an L-shaped site. While the lower section has a [[facade]] of [[limestone]], the upper stories incorporate a [[buff (colour)|buff]]-colored brick facade and contain numerous [[Setback (architecture)|setbacks]]. The facade also includes [[spandrel]]s between the windows on each story, which are recessed behind the vertical [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] on the facade. At the top of the building is a pyramid with a spire at its pinnacle. Inside, the lower floors contained the Manhattan Company's double-height banking room, a board room, a trading floor, and two basements with vaults. The remaining stories were rented to tenants; there were private clubs on several floors, as well as an observation deck on the 69th and 70th floors.

Plans for 40 Wall Street were revealed in April 1929, with the Manhattan Company as the primary tenant, and the structure was opened on May 26, 1930. 40 Wall Street and the [[Chrysler Building]] competed for the distinction of [[List of tallest buildings in the world|world's tallest building]] at the time of both buildings' construction; the Chrysler Building ultimately won that title. 40 Wall Street initially had low tenancy rates due to the [[Great Depression]] and was not fully occupied until 1944. Ownership of the building and the land underneath it, as well as the [[Leasehold estate|leasehold]] on the building, has changed several times throughout its history. Since 1982, the building has been owned by two German companies. The leasehold was held by interests on behalf of Philippine dictator [[Ferdinand Marcos]] in the mid-1980s. A company controlled by developer and later U.S. president [[Donald Trump]] bought the lease in 1995.

== Site ==
40 Wall Street is in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] of [[Manhattan]], in the middle of the block bounded by Pine Street to the north, [[William Street (Manhattan)|William Street]] to the east, [[Wall Street]] to the south, and [[Nassau Street (Manhattan)|Nassau Street]] to the west. The site is L-shaped, with a longer facade on Pine Street than on Wall Street.<ref name="NYCityMap">{{Cite web |url=http://maps.nyc.gov/ |title=NYCityMap |website=NYC.gov |publisher=[[New York City Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications]] |access-date=March 20, 2020 |archive-date=May 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20150524114059/http://maps.nyc.gov/ |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="NPS p. 3">{{harvnb|National Park Service|2000|ps=.|p=3}}</ref><ref name="ZoLa">{{Cite web |title=14 Wall Street, 10005 |url=https://zola.planning.nyc.gov/l/lot/1/43/2#16.58/40.707025/-74.007895 |access-date=September 8, 2020 |publisher=[[New York City Department of City Planning]] |archive-date=February 19, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210219214852/https://zola.planning.nyc.gov/l/lot/1/43/2#16.58/40.707025/-74.007895 |url-status=live}}</ref> The lot measures {{Convert|209|ft|}} on Pine Street and {{cvt|150|ft|}} on Wall Street.<ref name="NPS p. 8">{{harvnb|National Park Service|2000|ps=.|p=8}}</ref> Originally, the site measured {{cvt|194|ft}} on Pine Street and 150 feet on Wall Street.<ref name="BM (1929) p. 2">{{harvnb|Bankers' Magazine|1929|ps=.|p=2}}</ref> The lot has a total area of {{convert|34360|ft2}}.<ref name="ZoLa"/>

40 Wall Street is surrounded by several buildings, including [[Federal Hall]] and 30 Wall Street to the west; 44 Wall Street and [[48 Wall Street]] to the east; [[55 Wall Street]] to the southeast; [[28 Liberty Street]] to the north; and [[23 Wall Street]] and [[15 Broad Street]] to the south.<ref name="NPS p. 3" /> The site slopes down southward so that the Pine Street entrance is on the second floor while the Wall Street entrance is on the first floor.<ref name="NPS p. 3" /><ref name="Abramson p. 100">{{Harvnb|Abramson|2001|ps=.|page=100}}</ref>

Prior to the current building's completion, the site was occupied by numerous smaller office buildings. The southern part of the site was occupied by the eight-story [[Gallatin National Bank|Gallatin Bank]] Building at 34–36 Wall Street, designed by [[J. Cleaveland Cady|Cady, Berg & See]] and completed in 1887; the nine-story Marshall Field Building at 38 Wall Street; the [[Manhattan Company]]'s original headquarters at 40 Wall Street; and a 13-story building to the east. The northern portion contained a 13-story building at 25 Pine Street, a 12-story building at 27–29 Pine Street, and the 13-story Redmond Building at 31–33 Pine Street.<ref name="BM (1929) p. 5">{{harvnb|Bankers' Magazine|1929|ps=.|p=5}}</ref>

=== Form ===
40 Wall Street, like many other early-20th-century skyscrapers in New York City, is designed as a freestanding tower, rising separately from all adjacent buildings. 40 Wall Street is one of several skyscrapers in the city that have pyramidal roofs, along with the [[Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower]], [[14 Wall Street]], [[Woolworth Building]], [[Consolidated Edison Building]], and [[Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse]].<ref name="NYCL p. 6" /> The building is [[Articulation (architecture)|articulated]] into three horizontal sections similar to the components of a [[column]], namely a base, shaft, and [[Capital (architecture)|capital]].<ref name="NYCL p. 6" /><ref name="Abramson p. 100" /> The floors at the six-story base cover the entire L-shaped lot, while the 7th through 35th stories (making up the middle section) are shaped in a "U", with two wings of different lengths facing west.<ref name="NPS p. 4">{{harvnb|National Park Service|2000|ps=.|p=4}}</ref><ref name="NYCL p. 7" /> The 7th through 35th stories occupy nearly the entire lot.<ref name="NPS p. 3" /><ref name="NYCL p. 7" /> Above the 35th story, the building rises as a smaller, square tower through the 62nd story.<ref name="NYCL p. 7" /><ref>{{harvnb|National Park Service|2000|ps=.|pp=3–4}}</ref>

40 Wall Street has several [[Setback (architecture)|setbacks]] to conform with New York City's [[1916 Zoning Resolution]].<ref name="NYCL p. 6" /> On the Wall Street side, the central portion of the facade is recessed through the 26th floor, while symmetrical pavilions project slightly on either side, with setbacks above the 17th, 19th, and 21st floors. The entire Wall Street facade has setbacks above the 26th, 33rd, and 35th floors. The Pine Street facade is asymmetrical, with the western pavilion being much longer; this facade has a setback above the 12th, 17th, 19th, 23rd, 26th, 28th, and 29th floors. The projecting pavilions on both sides are connected at the eighth floor by a [[dormer]].<ref name="NYCL p. 8" />

The building's west-facing wings are of different lengths; the northern wing is significantly longer and has cooling systems atop it, but both wings have minor setbacks above the 26th and 33rd floors, and rise only to the 35th floor. The eastern facade does not have any setbacks below the 35th story.<ref name="NYCL p. 8" />

=== Facade ===
40 Wall Street's exterior curtain wall is composed of two layers of brick; the inner layer provides fireproofing, while the outer layer is the exterior cladding.<ref name="Abramson p. 77">{{harvnb|Abramson|2001|ps=.|p=77}}</ref> In general, the facade is composed of [[Buff (colour)|buff]]-colored brick, as well as decorative elements made of [[terracotta]] and buff brick. The vertical [[Bay (architecture)|bays]], which contain the building's windows, are separated by piers.<ref name="NPS p. 4" /><ref name="NYCL p. 7" /> The piers are flat, a characteristic of the Art Deco style.<ref name="Robins2017" /> [[Spandrel]] panels, which separate the rows of windows on each floor, are generally recessed behind the piers; the spandrels are generally darker on upper stories.<ref name="NPS p. 4" /><ref name="NYCL p. 7" /> The building's window openings, initially composed of one-over-one [[sash window]]s, were later replaced by numerous types of window-pane arrangements or by louvers.<ref name="NYCL p. 7" />

==== Base ====
[[File:40 Wall Str Trump Building IMG 2031.jpg|thumb|Wall Street facade|alt=The facade of the building as seen from Wall Street. The first story is clad with granite and has several openings; the words "Trump Building" are visible above the granite columns. Above the first story are several floors of windows, which are separated by vertical stone piers.]]
The first through sixth stories contain a limestone-and-granite facade. On the first story, the podium on the facade's Wall Street [[Elevation (architecture)|elevation]] is made of granite. The second- to fifth-floor facades on both sides consist of a [[colonnade]] with [[pilaster]]s made of limestone.<ref name="NPS p. 3" /><ref name="NYCL p. 6" /> The colonnades were intended to resemble those found in Greek temples. During the design of the building, Matsui adjusted the colonnades to match the dimensions of the nearby Subtreasury building (now [[Federal Hall]]).<ref name="Abramson p. 100" />

On the Wall Street side, the first floor originally had a central entryway with three bronze-and-glass doors, flanked by numerous entrances to the elevator lobby and the lower banking room.<ref name="NYCL p. 7" /> Double-height bronze and glass windows spanned the second and third floors, while cast-iron windows were on the fourth through sixth floors.<ref name="NYCL p. 8">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1995|ps=.|p=8}}</ref> Above the central entrance was [[Elie Nadelman]]'s ''Oceanus'' sculpture (also called ''Aquarius'');<ref>{{Cite news |date=April 26, 1930 |title=Oceanus Adorns Facade; New Skyscraper for Bank of Manhattan Building Gets Statue  |work=The New York Times |url-access=subscription |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1930/04/26/archives/oceanus-adorns-facade-new-skyscraper-for-bank-of-manhattan-building.html |issn=0362-4331 |access-date=March 31, 2021 |page=30}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name="NYCL p. 7" /> the sculpture was a {{convert|10|ft|m|-long|adj=mid}} bronze depiction of [[Oceanus]], a Greek [[Titans|Titan]] pictured on a 19th-century [[stock certificate]] issued by the Manhattan Company.<ref name="Abramson p. 101">{{harvnb|Abramson|2001|ps=.|p=101}}</ref> The ''Oceanus'' sculpture was removed prior to 1973.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kirstein |first=Lincoln |url=https://archive.org/details/elienadelman0000kirs |url-access=registration |title=Elie Nadelman |publisher=Eakins Press |year=1973 |page=[https://archive.org/details/elienadelman0000kirs/page/n233 230] |isbn=978-0-87130-034-8}}</ref> Between 1961 and 1963, [[Carson, Lundin & Shaw]] added granite cladding and reconfigured the doorways on the first floor, and replaced the second- through sixth-floor windows.<ref name="NYCL pp. 7-8">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1995|ps=.|pp=7–8}}</ref> By 1995, the entrance had been reconfigured with seven bronze rectangular doors and three revolving doors, recessed behind the main facade.<ref name="NYCL p. 8" /> Letters reading "The Trump Building" are placed above the first floor,<ref name="Bloomberg 2016" /> while the fourth floor has a pair of flagpoles.<ref name="NYCL p. 8" />

The Pine Street elevation is arranged similarly to the Wall Street elevation and was likewise redesigned from 1961 to 1963.<ref name="NYCL p. 8" /> The Pine Street elevation rises above a low [[stylobate]], in contrast to the Wall Street elevation, which rises above a podium.<ref name="Abramson p. 100" /> A {{Convert|6|ft|m|-diameter|adj=mid}} clock was on the Pine Street facade from 1967 to 1993. This portion of the facade consists of either 10<ref name="Abramson p. 100" /> or 11 bays.<ref name="NYCL p. 8" /> At ground level, there is an entrance to the main elevator lobby, a service entrance, and storefronts slightly above grade. As with the Wall Street side, the fourth floor features a pair of flagpoles.<ref name="NYCL p. 8" />

==== Upper stories ====
The 8th through 35th stories comprise the midsection of the building. There are eight flagpoles on the ninth floor of the Wall Street side, four on each pavilion. On the 19th floor of the Pine Street side, there are louvers in place of window openings.<ref name="NYCL p. 8" /> On the 36th through 62nd stories, there are brick spandrels between the windows on each story.<ref name="NPS p. 4" /><ref name="NYCL p. 8" /> The spandrels on the 52nd through 57th floors are made of terracotta; on the 58th through 60th floors, terracotta with [[buttress]]es; and on the 61st and 62nd floors, darker bricks with pediments and rhombus patterns.<ref name="NPS p. 4" />

The building's pyramidal roof is made of lead-coated copper, which over time has oxidized and turned green.<ref name="Nash 2005">{{cite book |last=Nash |first=Eric |title=Manhattan Skyscrapers |publisher=Princeton Architectural Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-56898-652-4 |publication-place=New York |pages=59 |oclc=407907000}}</ref><ref name="Abramson p. 78">{{harvnb|Abramson|2001|ps=.|p=78}}</ref> The roof has French Renaissance-style detail, a design element intended to make the building appear much older than it actually was at the time of its construction.<ref name="Nash 2005" /> The decorations on the roof include [[Diapering|diaperwork]] patterns, where the brickwork is laid in a repeating diagonal grid pattern; terraces, which are supported by buttresses; and small dormer windows.<ref name="Abramson pp. 101–102">{{harvnb|Abramson|2001|ps=.|pp=101–102}}</ref> There is a cornice surrounding the roof.<ref name="NPS p. 4" /> On top is a spire with a flagpole and a glass lantern.<ref name="NYCL p. 8" /><ref name="Abramson pp. 101–102" />

Because of late changes to the plans of both 40 Wall Street and the Chrysler Building, as well as the fact that the buildings were erected nearly simultaneously, it is uncertain whether 40 Wall Street was ever taller than the Chrysler Building.

==== 1946 plane crash ====
On the evening of May 20, 1946, a [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[Beechcraft Model 18|Beechcraft C-45F Expediter]] airplane crashed into 40 Wall Street's northern facade. The twin-engine plane was heading for [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark Airport]] on a flight originating at [[Chennault Air Force Base|Lake Charles Army Air Field]] in [[Louisiana]]. It struck the 58th floor of the building at about 8:10&nbsp;pm, creating a {{convert|20|x|10|ft|m|adj=on}} hole in the masonry. The crash killed all five aboard the plane, including a [[Women's Army Corps (United States Army)|WAC]] officer, though no one in the building or on the ground was hurt. The fuselage and the wing of the splintered plane fell onto the 12th-story setback, while parts of the aircraft and pieces of brick and mortar from the building fell into the street below. Fog and low visibility were identified as the main causes of the crash, since [[LaGuardia Airport|LaGuardia Field]] had reported a heavy fog that reduced the ceiling to {{convert|500|ft|m}}, obscuring the view of the ground for the pilot at the building's 58th story.<ref name="nyt19460521">{{Cite news |url-access=subscription |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1946/05/21/archives/pilot-lost-in-fog-scene-of-plane-crash-last-night-airplane-crashes.html |title=Pilot Lost in Fog; Scene of Plane Crash Last Night Airplane Crashes Into Skyscraper |date=May 21, 1946 |work=The New York Times |access-date=April 27, 2020 |url-status=live  |issn=0362-4331 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200216193054/https://www.nytimes.com/1946/05/21/archives/pilot-lost-in-fog-scene-of-plane-crash-last-night-airplane-crashes.html |archive-date=February 16, 2020}}</ref><ref name="p1284524778">{{cite news |last=Peck |first=Robert B. |date=May 21, 1946 |title=Army Plane Rams Tallest Wall St. Tower; 5 Die in Fog at Dusk at 58th Floor of No. 40 |page=1 |work=New York Herald Tribune |issn=1941-0646 |id={{ProQuest|1284524778}}}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Moore |first=William |url=https://chicagotribune.newspapers.com/clip/49647960/ |title=Plane Hits Wall St. Bank |date=May 21, 1946 |issn=1085-6706 |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=April 26, 2020 |page=1 |archive-date=August 3, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210803153551/https://chicagotribune.newspapers.com/clip/49647960/plane-hits-wall-st-bank/ |url-status=live}}</ref>
